# Step 1. Import the necessary libraries
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
# Step 2. Create 3 differents Series, each of length 100, as follows:
# 1. The first a random number from 1 to 4

# 2. The second a random number from 1 to 3

# 3. The third a random number from 10,000 to 30,000

# Step 3. Let's create a DataFrame by joinning the Series by column

# Step 4. Change the name of the columns to bedrs, bathrs, price_sqr_meter

# Step 5. Create a one column DataFrame with the values of the 3 Series and assign it to 'bigcolumn'

# Step 6. Oops, it seems it is going only until index 99. Is it true?

# Step 7. Reindex the DataFrame so it goes from 0 to 299
